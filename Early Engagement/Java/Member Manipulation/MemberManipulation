Member Manipulation

Like the book details the district library wants to store the details about their members.So that it is easy to provide login credentials for those members to access books online. The application should be a menu driven. Develop an application to implement the scenario. 

You are provided with  a class Member with the following private attributes:

    int memberId
    String memberName
    String address

Necessary public getter and setter methods are provided.

A  no argument constructor and a 3 arguments constructor ( memberId, memberName and address) are also provided.

Create a class Library which has an  ArrayList of member as attribute as : 

List<Member> memberList = new ArrayList<Member>().  

Write the getter and setter.

 Also Library class should have the following methods :

     public void addMember(Member memberObj)  -  This method should add the memberObj to the memberList.
     public List<Member> viewAllMembers()  -  This method should return the memberList.
     public List<Member> viewMembersByAddress(String address)  -  This method should return the list of members who belong to that address.

Create a class Main which has the main method.  In the main function write the code to create the menu and invoke the needed functions based on the choice provided.

Design the UI as shown in the samples below.
